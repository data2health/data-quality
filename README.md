# Data Quality Methods and Tools to Support CTSA Hub Data Sharing
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data must be tested for data quality when being shared for research. Data quality is typically measured in three categories: Conformance, Completeness, and Plausibility (Kahn et al., 2016 eGEMS). Many CTSA institutions have harmonized their EHR data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model, yet no publicly available tool with a standard operating procedure (SOP) exists to easily assess and visualize data quality tests, particularly across institutions. This project will launch a publically available data quality testing tool and SOP, configurable to any database environment for N OMOP datasets.
